## Overview

**Drone Commander** is an interactive web-based application designed for simulating drone flight control using Blockly and Three.js. Users can visually program the drone's movements using drag-and-drop blocks, and then see the drone execute those commands in a 3D simulation.

## Features

- **Visual Programming**: Utilize Blockly to create flight programs without writing code.
- **3D Simulation**: Watch your programmed drone fly in a realistic 3D environment powered by Three.js.
- **Intuitive UI**: A split interface with a Blockly editor, 3D viewer, and status panel.
- **Custom Blocks**: Includes blocks for takeoff, landing, altitude control, direction setting, and movement.
- **Keyboard Sensors**: Detect key presses to interact with the drone in real-time.
- **Simulation Controls**: Play, pause, and reset the simulation easily.
- **File Management**: Save and load Blockly programs.
- **Resizable UI**: Adjust the layout by resizing panels or switching to fullscreen mode.
